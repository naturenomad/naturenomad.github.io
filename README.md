Github personal web pages for naturenomad.
I'm an experienced web and database developer, who has taken an extended break to start a family. This site is to accompany my return to coding.
I'm using hackerrank and freecodecamp, interested in exercism.io. Some problem solving from these may appear here, as well as some personal web page play.

Please go to https://naturenomad.github.io for the displayed web pages.
